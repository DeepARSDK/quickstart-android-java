2. Create a DeepAR developer account: https://developer.deepar.ai/signup. 
3. Create a project: https://developer.deepar.ai/projects. 
4. Add a Android app to the project. Note that you need to specify the `applicationId` of your app. The `applicationId` is located in the `app/build.gradle` and in this case it is "ai.deepar.deepar_example".
